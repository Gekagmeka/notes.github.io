You can use different properties like

$('[data-fancybox="gallery"]').fancybox({
	buttons : [
		'slideShow',
		'share',
		'zoom',
		'fullScreen',
		'close'
	],
	thumbs : {
		autoStart: true
	},
	protect: true
});


Where
1) 'slideShow' = allows to play slides, that are connected in gallery
2) 'share' = add a button in browser 'to share'
3) 'zoom' = allows to bring closer/move away if image is very big and it doesn't place in screen
4) 'fullScreen' = allow to be this button when image is opened
5) 'close' = allows to be this button when image is opened
6) thumbs : {
		autoStart: true
	} = other diffetnt images also are viewed, but they are in the right top corner
7) protect: true = allows to save copyright (you can't to copy the image)
